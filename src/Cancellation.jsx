<b>1. Our Commitment</b>
<br/>
At the CAPACITY BUILDING PROGRAM, we are dedicated to providing a transformative learning experience through our comprehensive 5-day soft skill development program. Our commitment involves significant upfront investment in securing expert facilitators, procuring high-quality materials, and arranging logistics to ensure a seamless and valuable experience for all participants. This policy is designed to be fair to our participants while accounting for the resources we commit to upon registration.
<br/><br/>
<b>2. Participant-Initiated Cancellation</b>
<br/>
We understand that circumstances can change. Should you need to cancel your registration, please adhere to the following procedure and timelines.
<br/>
<b>2.1. Cancellation Procedure</b>
<br/>
To officially request a cancellation, a written notification must be sent via email to our administration office at cbpmnit@gmail.com. The email must include the following information to be considered a valid request:
<br/>
Subject Line: Cancellation Request: [Your Full Name]
<br/>
Full Name of Participant:
<br/>
Registration ID / Order Number:
<br/>
Date of Payment:
<br/>
Reason for Cancellation (Optional, but appreciated for feedback):
<br/>
Verbal cancellations or requests made through other channels will not be accepted. The date and time the email is received by our server will be considered the official time of the cancellation request.
<br/>
<b>2.2. Cancellation Timelines & Refund Eligibility</b>
<br/>
Refunds are processed based on the date of the cancellation request relative to the date of the original transaction.
<br/>
Full Refund Window (Within 48 Hours of Transaction):
A cancellation request received within 48 hours (2 days) of the initial payment will be eligible for a 100% refund, provided that no physical or digital materials have been dispatched or accessed.
<br/>
Late Cancellation (After 48 Hours of Transaction):
Cancellation requests received more than 48 hours (2 days) after the initial payment are not eligible for a refund. After this period, we will have allocated resources, confirmed arrangements with vendors, and committed costs on your behalf, making a refund unfeasible.
<br/>
Post-Program Commencement:
No refunds will be issued for cancellations requested after the official start date of the program, regardless of attendance.
<br/><br/>
<b>3. Deductions for Delivered Materials</b>
<br/>
Our program includes valuable digital and physical resources. In the event of an eligible cancellation (within the 48-hour window), the following conditions apply:
<br/>
Digital Content (eBooks): If you have been granted access to, or have downloaded, the digital eBooks, their standard retail value will be deducted from the total refund amount. Access is tracked via our digital delivery system.
<br/>
Physical Merchandise (T-shirts, etc.): If your physical merchandise package has been dispatched or shipped, the cost of the items plus shipping and handling fees will be deducted from the total refund amount.
<br/><br/>
<b>4. Non-Refundable Circumstances</b>
<br/>
Please note that refunds will not be granted under the following circumstances:
<br/>
Partial Attendance or "No-Shows": Participants who miss one or more sessions, or do not attend the program at all without prior formal cancellation, are not eligible for a refund.
<br/>
Accessed Digital Content: All digital materials, once accessed or downloaded, are considered consumed and are non-refundable.
<br/>
Dispatched Physical Merchandise: All physical merchandise, once shipped, is non-refundable. Please refer to our Merchandise Exchange Policy in Section 5 for specific exceptions regarding T-shirts.
<br/><br/>
<b>5. Merchandise Exchange Policy (T-Shirts)</b>
<br/>
While merchandise is non-refundable, we offer a one-time exchange for T-shirts in cases of incorrect sizing or manufacturing defects, subject to the following conditions:
<br/>
Eligibility: An exchange can be requested if the T-shirt received is a different size than what was ordered or if it has a clear manufacturing defect.
<br/>
Condition: The T-shirt must be in its original, unworn, and unwashed condition with all tags attached.
<br/>
Timeframe: The exchange request must be initiated via email within 7 days of receiving the merchandise.
<br/>
Exchange Process:

Email cbpmnit@gmail.com with the subject line "Merchandise Exchange - [Your Registration ID]".
<br/>
In the email, include your full name, the issue (e.g., "Size L received, ordered M"), and a clear photograph of the item and its tag.

Our team will review the request and provide instructions for returning the original item.
<br/>
Exchange Fee: A mandatory exchange fee, equivalent to 10% of the T-shirt's initial cost, will be charged. This fee covers the two-way shipping and handling costs for the exchange. Instructions for payment will be provided upon approval of the request.
<br/>
Availability: All exchanges are subject to stock availability of the requested size.
<br/><br/>
<b>6. Program Alteration or Cancellation by Organizer</b>
<br/>
In the unlikely event that the CAPACITY BUILDING PROGRAM must be cancelled, rescheduled, or significantly altered due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g., facilitator illness, insufficient enrollment, or force majeure events), registered participants will be notified promptly. In such cases, participants will be offered the choice of:

A full 100% refund of the registration fee paid.

A complimentary transfer of their registration to the next available program date.

The CAPACITY BUILDING PROGRAM is not liable for any travel, accommodation, or other incidental expenses incurred by participants in the event of a program cancellation.
<br/><br/>
<b>7. Refund Processing</b>
<br/>
Upon verification of your request, the refund will be processed and credited back to the original payment method within 6-7 working days. You will receive a confirmation notification once the refund is initiated.
<br/><br/>
<b>8. Policy Acknowledgment</b>
<br/>
By completing the registration and making a payment, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions outlined in this Cancellation and Refund Policy.
